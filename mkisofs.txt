mkisofs -o $ISONAME.iso -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -l -allow-leading-dots -relaxed-filenames -joliet-long -max-iso9660-filenames -D -R -J -T -V $VOLID -v /path/to/directory/full/of/files
The switches are as follows:

-l = enables Long file names
-allow-leading-dots = enables filenames with a period in the beginning.
-max-iso9660-filenames: LOOK UP MAN FILE
-R = enables RockRidge.
-J = Enables Joliet support for long file names.
-T = generates a Trans.tbl in each directory which is used on non-RR capable systems to help establish correct file names.
-joliet-long = LOOK UP MAN FILE
-V = Volume Name
-D = Do not use deep directory relocation, and instead just pack them in the way we see them.
If ISO9660:1999 has not been selected, this violates the ISO9660 standard, but it happens to work on many systems. Use with caution.
-relaxed-filenames = LOOK UP MAN FILE

This will create a bootable dvd that also contains extra files. Remember to check the filenames and file paths to make sure that long file names work.
